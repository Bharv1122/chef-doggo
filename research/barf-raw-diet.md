# BARF / Raw Food Diet for Dogs

## Overview
BARF stands for "Biologically Appropriate Raw Food" or "Bones and Raw Food." It's based on the principle that dogs should eat what their ancestors ate - raw meat, bones, and organs.

## Two Main Raw Feeding Models

### 1. BARF Diet Ratios
| Component | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Muscle Meat | 70% |
| Raw Edible Bone | 10% |
| Vegetables | 7% |
| Liver | 5% |
| Other Secreting Organs | 5% |
| Seeds/Nuts | 2% |
| Fruit | 1% |

### 2. Prey Model / 80-10-10 Rule
| Component | Percentage |
|-----------|------------|
| Muscle Meat | 80% |
| Raw Edible Bone | 10% |
| Organ Meat (half liver) | 10% |

## Daily Feeding Amounts

| Life Stage | % of Body Weight |
|------------|------------------|
| Adult Dogs (normal activity) | 2-3% |
| Active/Working Dogs | 3-4% |
| Puppies | 4-6% |
| Senior Dogs | 1.5-2% |

**Example:** A 50 lb dog would eat 1-1.5 lbs of raw food daily.

## Key Principles

### Protein Sources
- At least 50% should be "red meat" (more nutrient-dense than white meat)
- Rotate proteins to prevent allergies and ensure nutritional variety
- Include fish 1-2x per week for omega-3s

### Bone Content
- 10% refers to actual bone material, not bone-in meat weight
- Too much bone = constipation (white, chalky stool)
- Too little bone = loose stool

### Organ Meats
- Liver is essential (5% of diet) - richest source of vitamins
- Other secreting organs: kidney, spleen, pancreas, brain, thymus
- Heart is considered muscle meat, not organ

## Safe Raw Meaty Bones by Size

| Dog Size | Recommended Bones |
|----------|-------------------|
| Small | Chicken necks, wings, rabbit |
| Medium | Chicken quarters, duck necks, turkey necks |
| Large | Beef ribs, lamb necks, pork necks |

**Never feed:** Cooked bones (splinter), weight-bearing bones from large animals (too hard)

## Vegetables for BARF

Must be pureed or lightly steamed for digestibility:
- Leafy greens (spinach, kale)
- Cruciferous (broccoli, cauliflower)
- Root vegetables (carrots, sweet potato)
- Squash, zucchini, pumpkin

## Food Safety

- Keep raw food between 32-42°F
- Thaw in refrigerator, not at room temperature
- Clean bowls and surfaces after feeding
- Wash hands thoroughly

## Transitioning to Raw

| Day | Raw % | Previous Food % |
|-----|-------|-----------------|
| 1-3 | 25% | 75% |
| 4-6 | 50% | 50% |
| 7-9 | 75% | 25% |
| 10+ | 100% | 0% |

Some dogs do better with a "cold turkey" switch (24-hour fast, then raw only).

## Benefits Claimed
- Shinier coat
- Healthier skin
- Cleaner teeth
- Higher energy
- Smaller, less smelly stools

## Risks to Consider
- Bacterial contamination (Salmonella, E. coli)
- Nutritional imbalances if not properly formulated
- Choking hazards from bones
- Not suitable for immunocompromised dogs

## Important Note
Raw diets require careful balancing. Consider adding supplements (calcium if not feeding enough bone, omega-3s, vitamin E) and consult with a veterinary nutritionist.
