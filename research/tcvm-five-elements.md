# TCVM Five Elements Constitution Types

## Overview
The Five Element theory (Wu Xing) is a cosmologic philosophy developed in ancient China. In TCVM, it's used to understand the patient's personality type and possible disease tendencies. Each individual has properties of all five elements but one or more tend to predominate.

## Constitution Types and Characteristics

| Constitution | Characteristics |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Fire** | Extrovert, easily excited, center of party, the "kisser," difficult to calm down, exaggerates, sharp mental activity |
| **Earth** | Honest, kind, maternal, laid back, easily satisfied, aloof from the world, slow to respond to stimulus |
| **Metal** | Broadminded, wise, rule follower, aloof, righteous, confident |
| **Water** | Introvert, quiet observer, fearful, deep thinker, can be fear biter, consistent but slow |
| **Wood** | Extrovert, dominant, impatient, vigilant, enjoys moving/running, quick tempered, changes mind easily |

## Associated Organ Systems
Each of the Five Elements is associated energetically with an internal organ system:
- Fire → Heart
- Earth → Spleen/Stomach
- Metal → Lung
- Water → Kidney
- Wood → Liver

## Lifestyle Recommendations by Constitution
- **Fire and Wood Constitution animals**: Would not be content just staying home all the time - need activity and stimulation
- **Earth and Water Constitutions**: Would be fine staying home, but still need regular exercise for mental and physical health

## Food Energetics (Warming/Cooling/Neutral)

### Warming Proteins (for cold/lethargic dogs)
- Lamb (most warming)
- Venison
- Chicken (warming to neutral)
- Beef (neutral to warming)

### Cooling Proteins (for hot/inflamed/allergic dogs)
- Duck (most cooling)
- Rabbit
- Fish (cod, mackerel, sardines)
- Whitefish
- Pork (neutral to cooling)

### Neutral Proteins (balanced choice)
- Turkey
- Salmon
- Pork

## Seasonal Adjustments
- **Spring/Summer**: Use cooling proteins (duck, whitefish) for dogs prone to overheating or allergies
- **Fall/Winter**: Use warming proteins (lamb, venison) for circulation and comfort, especially seniors

## When to Use TCVM Food Therapy
- Chronic skin inflammation → Switch to cooling proteins
- Lethargy/weakness → Use warming foods
- Allergies → Avoid warming foods (chicken, lamb, shrimp, rice, corn)
- Digestive issues → Use sweet flavors to neutralize and nourish

## Important Note
TCVM complements modern nutritional science - medical requirements (diabetes, kidney disease) take precedence over energetic considerations.
