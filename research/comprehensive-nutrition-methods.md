## 2. Life Stage Nutrition

### Puppy (Growth)
- Higher protein: 22-32% (vs 18-25% adult)
- Higher fat: 8-20%
- Higher calcium: but not excessive (large breed puppies)
- DHA for brain development
- Feed 3-4 times daily, gradually reduce to 2x

### Adult Maintenance
- Protein: 18-25%
- Fat: 10-15%
- Moderate calories based on activity

### Senior (7+ years)
- Slightly higher protein (to prevent muscle loss)
- Lower calories (reduced metabolism)
- Joint support: glucosamine, chondroitin, omega-3s
- Antioxidants for cognitive health

### Pregnant/Lactating
- Increase food by 25-50% during pregnancy
- May need 2-3x normal calories during lactation
- Higher calcium and protein needs

---

## 3. Breed-Specific Nutrition

### Large/Giant Breeds (>50 lbs)
- Controlled calcium for puppies (prevent bone disorders)
- Joint support supplements
- Lower calorie density to prevent rapid growth
- Glucosamine/chondroitin for hip/joint health

### Small Breeds (<20 lbs)
- Higher calorie density (faster metabolism)
- Smaller kibble size
- More frequent meals (prone to hypoglycemia)

### Brachycephalic Breeds (Bulldogs, Pugs)
- Weight management critical
- Avoid foods that cause gas
- Easy-to-eat food shapes

### Dalmatians
- Low purine diet (prone to urate stones)
- Avoid organ meats, sardines, mackerel

### Breeds Prone to DCM
- Ensure adequate taurine
- Avoid grain-free diets with legumes as primary ingredient

---

## 4. Rotational Feeding

### Principles
- Rotate proteins every 1-4 weeks
- Rotate brands/formulas periodically
- Prevents food sensitivities
- Ensures nutritional variety

### Rotation Schedule Example
| Week | Protein |
|------|---------|
| 1-2 | Chicken |
| 3-4 | Beef |
| 5-6 | Fish |
| 7-8 | Turkey |

### Benefits
- Reduced allergy development
- Broader nutrient profile
- Less picky eating
- Gut microbiome diversity

## 5. Functional Foods

### Anti-Inflammatory
- Turmeric (with black pepper for absorption)
- Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil)
- Blueberries
- Ginger

### Joint Health
- Bone broth (collagen, glucosamine)
- Green-lipped mussel
- Eggshell membrane

### Digestive Health
- Pumpkin (fiber)
- Probiotics (kefir, yogurt)
- Slippery elm
- Digestive enzymes

### Cognitive Support (Senior Dogs)
- MCT oil (coconut oil)
- Antioxidants (vitamin E, C)
- DHA/EPA

### Immune Support
- Mushrooms (shiitake, reishi)
- Spirulina
- Colostrum

---

## 6. Condition-Specific Diets

### Anti-Inflammatory Diet
**For:** Allergies, arthritis, chronic inflammation
- Cooling proteins: duck, rabbit, fish
- Omega-3 rich foods
- Avoid: chicken, beef, wheat, corn
- Add: turmeric, ginger, leafy greens

### Ketogenic Diet
**For:** Epilepsy, cancer support
- Very low carb (<5%)
- High fat (70-80%)
- Moderate protein
- MCT oil supplementation
- **Must be veterinarian supervised**

### Renal Diet
**For:** Kidney disease
- Controlled protein (high quality, moderate amount)
- Low phosphorus
- Low sodium
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Increased B vitamins
- **Requires veterinary guidance**

### Cardiac Diet
**For:** Heart disease
- Adequate taurine and L-carnitine
- Low sodium
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Adequate magnesium and potassium
- CoQ10 supplementation

### Diabetic Diet
**For:** Diabetes
- High fiber
- Complex carbohydrates
- Consistent feeding schedule
- Avoid simple sugars

---

## 7. Elimination Diet Protocol

### Purpose
Identify food allergies/intolerances

### Process
1. **Phase 1 (8-12 weeks):** Single novel protein + single carb
   - Examples: Venison + sweet potato, Duck + pea
2. **Phase 2:** Reintroduce one ingredient every 2 weeks
3. **Phase 3:** Monitor for reactions (itching, GI upset)
4. **Phase 4:** Build safe food list

### Common Allergens to Test
1. Beef
2. Dairy
3. Chicken
4. Wheat
5. Lamb
6. Soy
7. Corn
8. Eggs

## Integration Notes for Recipe Generation

When generating recipes, the AI should:
1. Check dog's life stage → apply appropriate nutrient ratios
2. Check breed → apply breed-specific considerations
3. Check health conditions → apply condition-specific restrictions
4. Check selected nutrition philosophy (TCVM, Ayurveda, BARF, etc.)
5. Cross-reference all requirements to ensure compatibility
6. Flag any conflicts between methods
7. Always ensure NRC minimums are met regardless of philosophy
